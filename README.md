## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture Improvements

- **Service Worker**: Manages recording state and coordinates all components
- **Content Scripts**: 
  - `console-interceptor.js`: Captures console output
  - `rrweb-recorder.js`: Records DOM changes and interactions
- **Offscreen Document**: Handles MediaRecorder API for video capture
- **Review Interface**: Full-featured SPA for reviewing recordings

### Data Storage

- Recordings are stored in Chrome's local storage
- Large blobs (video, DOM events) are stored separately
- Automatic cleanup keeps only the 10 most recent recordings

### Security & Privacy

- All data is stored locally
- Sensitive inputs can be masked in DOM recordings
- Network requests are filtered to essential information
- No telemetry or external data sharing

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Keep recordings focused** - Record only what's needed to demonstrate the bug
2. **Use appropriate capture mode** - Tab recording is usually sufficient
3. **Add context** - Use the summary fields to provide additional information
4. **Review before submitting** - Check that sensitive information is not included
5. **Use AI suggestions as a starting point** - Always review and edit AI-generated content

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Recording won't start
- Check that you're not on a Chrome system page (chrome://)
- Ensure all permissions are granted
- Try reloading the extension

### No video in review
- Some sites may block screen recording
- Try using DOM recording instead
- Check browser console for errors

### Jira submission fails
- Verify your API credentials
- Check that the project and issue type exist
- Ensure you have permission to create issues
